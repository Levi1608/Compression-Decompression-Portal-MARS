#  Compressor - File Compression & Decompression Web App

**Compressor** is a browser-based tool that lets users upload, compress, and decompress files using algorithms like **Huffman Coding**, **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**, and **LZ77**. It also shows how effective each algorithm is — visually and statistically.


##  Features (Explained)

###  File Upload
Upload any file (text, image, or binary) directly from your device. Supported formats include `.txt`, `.json`, `.png`, etc. (max 10MB).

###  Algorithm Selection
Choose between Huffman Coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), or LZ77 before starting the compression or decompression process.

###  Compression
Click **"Compress"** to apply the selected algorithm on the uploaded file and reduce its size in-browser — no backend required.

###  Decompression
Click **"Decompress"** to revert a previously compressed file back to its original form using the same algorithm.

### Compression Statistics
Get real-time data including:
- Original file size
- Compressed/decompressed size
- Compression ratio (e.g. 2.5x smaller)
- Time taken for the operation (in ms)

### Download Processed Files
After processing, download the resulting file (compressed or decompressed) instantly with a new meaningful filename.

###  Algorithm Descriptions
Click a button to learn how each compression algorithm works, with simple, easy-to-understand explanations.

### Error Handling
Smart error alerts if you:
- Upload unsupported file types
- Try to decompress invalid data
- Select an algorithm incorrectly

### Fully Client-Side
The entire app runs in your browser using **JavaScript + FileReader API** — no server needed for compression or decompression.

### Responsive Design
Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly interface that works on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
